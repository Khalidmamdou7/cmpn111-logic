## Running the Simulation

The simulation and the testbenches could be run using ModelSim or Quartus. You would need to create a new project and add the [verilog files](verilog-files/) to it. Then, you could simulate the design or the testbench.

I only added the verilog files to avoid conflicts while running the code on a different environment.
